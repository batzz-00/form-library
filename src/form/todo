more actions
action={finishTyping} < more of these
wait={500}
do={func}
try do this in a HOC if possible

more validators

add custom h1s and props that requite a prop like ignore so the form children loop ignores it

limit filetypes
show file format 

if two children have same name either somehow duplicate or send warning 

make it so validator errors can have parameters ? 

have errors on individual parts of the block (123 456 789) where 123 is highlighted for some reason - not possible with css :( 

add time rules on the inputspacer (another helper maybe, could use moment but id rather do it myself)

make return from onSubmit with an optional prop that lets data be returned as formdata instead of object, just ease of use
